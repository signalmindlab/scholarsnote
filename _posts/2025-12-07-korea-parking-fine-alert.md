## 🚨 The Korean Parking Fine Hack: How to Get a Warning Text *Before* the Ticket

### Introduction: Stop Throwing Money Away!

If you drive in South Korea, you know the fear: that sudden realization you've parked in the wrong spot, followed by the inevitable hefty fine. For a passenger car on a general road, the standard illegal parking fine is **40,000 KRW**. Korean parking enforcement is efficient and automated by CCTV cameras. But what if there was a completely legal way to get a secret heads-up—a text message—giving you just enough time to move your car and save your money?

Good news: you can! By registering for a pre-enforcement **"Warning System,"** you get a 5–10 minute grace period to correct your mistake. Here’s how to set it up, whether you’re a local or a traveler.

## 1️⃣ The All-in-One Solution: Whistle (010car.kr) 📱

If you travel across different Korean cities, signing up for every single local warning system is a huge hassle. **Whistle** is the integrated answer.

### ✅ Why Use Whistle?
* **Mass Coverage:** This mobile app covers **over 100 Korean cities and regions** with a single, easy registration.
* **Pure Convenience:** Manage all your parking alerts in one place, perfect for travelers and commuters.

## 2️⃣ The Official Backup: The Wizshot System (Local Gov't)

Sometimes, smaller towns or very specific local districts aren't covered by Whistle. That’s where the official local system comes in. The underlying technology is often provided by platforms like Wizshot (B2G).

### ✅ Why Use the Local System?
* **Comprehensive Local Coverage:** Essential for residents whose city might not be on the integrated Whistle network.
* **Official Connection:** Direct link to your local municipality's CCTV system.

### 🔗 How to Register:

#### **Method A: The Easiest National App**

* Download the national sign-up app called **"주정차단속알림서비스 통합가입도우미"** (Parking Enforcement Alert Service Integrated Sign-up Helper). This app is designed to help you register for most local city services at once.

#### **Method B: Direct City Link**

* Search on Google for your city name (e.g., "Busan-si") and the keywords **"주정차단속알림서비스 신청"** (Parking Enforcement Alert Service Application) to find the official sign-up page for your local government office.

## 🔥 **The Catch: Where Alerts Will FAIL You & The Cost**

It’s crucial to know that the warning system **does not work** in areas of immediate enforcement. Parking in these "Death Zones" results in an instant fine, regardless of your registration status, and the penalties are significantly higher:

* **School Zones (Child Protection Zones)**
    * **Penalty:** **120,000 KRW** for passenger cars (three times the normal fine).
    * **Why Alerts Fail:** Notifications are not sent in child protection zones.
* **Fire Hydrants (within 5 meters)**
    * **Penalty:** **80,000 KRW** for passenger cars.
    * **Why Alerts Fail:** This is one of the "four illegal zones" that result in immediate fines upon citizen reporting.
* **Crosswalks (Zebra Crossings)**
    * **Why Alerts Fail:** This is one of the "four illegal zones" that result in immediate fines upon citizen reporting.
* **Bus Stops**
    * **Why Alerts Fail:** This is one of the "four illegal zones" that result in immediate fines upon citizen reporting.
* **Citizen Reporting:** Fines are issued immediately when a pedestrian reports your car via the **Safety e-Report** app.
* **On-Site Enforcement:** Fines are issued instantly by police or traffic wardens.

> **Final Takeaway:** These warning systems are a fantastic safety net, but they are not a license to park illegally. Always move your car immediately upon receiving a warning text!
